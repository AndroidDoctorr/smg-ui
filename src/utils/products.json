Because this growing tray is smaller than standard trays, pre-cut hydroponic pads designed for 10x20 trays won't fit it without alteration. The ideal grow media for these kits is potting soil, loose coco coir or micro mat hydroponic confetti. Ideal for selling full grown trays to restaurants, natural food grocers and at farmer's markets.

        "descriptionlong": "These growing trays (with drain holes) are formed from dense paper and is perfect for microgreens and wheatgrass. They are intended for a single use and are fully compostable. They resist water and will hold their shape well for a single grow. The trays measure approximately 19 long by 9 inches wide and has a shallow depth of approximately 1.5 inches. It nests inside a standard 10x20 inch drip tray with plenty of room to spare. Because this growing tray is smaller than standard trays, pre-cut hydroponic pads designed for 10x20 trays won't fit it without alteration. The ideal grow media for these kits is potting soil, loose coco coir or micro mat hydroponic confetti. Ideal for selling full grown trays to restaurants, natural food grocers and at farmer's markets. Note: Requires more water than normal tray as well as more consistent watering as the edges and the middle dry out quicker than the rest of the tray. Note: Since it dries out quicker than other trays, mold has a lower chance of thriving in your microgreens or wheatgrass.",
